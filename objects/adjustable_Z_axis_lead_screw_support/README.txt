# Summary

Warning: I have just realised that installing this on your Creality 3d printer will reduce the usable Z height available for printing. So be careful with the height of items you are printing! You probably want limit the Z axis to 25mm less than the specs. If you have a knob on your extruder you will have to limit it by more.

On the Creality printers the lead screw that drives the Z axis is usually not supported at the top. I designed this adjustable support to fill that gap.

The support takes a 688ZZ bearing (16mm OD, 8mm ID, 5mm width) to support the lead screw and allow it to turn freely. These can be obtained cheaply from eBay or any other online market.

The support can slide sideways in the V-groove. The bearing holder has 4mm of movement allowing the bearing to be precisely aligned to your printers lead screw.

Hardware required:
1 x 688ZZ bearing
2 x M5x20 bolt
2 x M5 T-nut
2 x M3x12 (16 and 20 also supported) bolt
2 x M3 nut

While all of the design files are my own, I wish to acknowledge that the idea and basic structure come from the "CR-10 Dual Z axis with single stepper. Low cost high precision." by Caster.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Creality
Printer: Ender 3
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2mm
Infill: 40%
Filament_brand: Generic
Filament_color: Black
Filament_material: PLA

Notes: 
Provided you don't over tighten the screws then 40% infill should give sufficient strength. I also like to print with 3 shell layers (top, bottom and sides) for added strength with structural parts.

The model has design details that prevents the need for supports while printing. However when finished you will need to run a 3mm drill down through the top holes (it can be done by hand) to clear out the supports.

There should be enough tolerances built in to allow direct from print bed assembly, at least it is for my Ender 3. Note that once the bearing is pressed in, the bearing holder becomes a snug fit in the block. You may need a screwdriver to slide it back and forth for adjustment.

# Post-Printing

## Remove M3 nut slot bridge

There is a thin bridge above the not slot that blocks off the 3mm screw hole. You will need to clear that with a 3mm drill (can be done by hand as it is only 0.2mm thick). You could probably poke it out with something else if you don't have a drill at hand. You might need tweezers to clear any filament strands from the nut slots.
